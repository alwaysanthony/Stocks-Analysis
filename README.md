# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We are helping Steve diversify his parents' portfolio. With the data Steve has provided, we will use automated processes through the use of VBA in Excel to analyze and highlight this information.


## Analysis

### Results

After analyzing the data, we were able to determine that DQ returned 199.4% in 2017 but did not do as well in 2018 returning -62.6%. Steve was right in wanting to diversify his parents' portfolio. When working with this much data, it is quite easy to get lost. To make things a little easier for Steve, we've created buttons to analyze the data according to the year as well as color code tickers with green for gains and red for losses.
